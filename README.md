# 📊 Pymaceuticals Inc. - Tumor Treatment Study (Girly Style)

This project analyzes data from a pharmaceutical study focused on the effectiveness of various drug regimens in treating mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

## 🧪 Overview
Using data from 249 mice treated with different drugs, we:
- Cleaned and merged datasets
- Calculated summary statistics
- Created visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, box plots, violin plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps
- Identified outliers and trends
- Explored correlation between tumor volume and mouse weight

## 🎀 Visual Style
All plots are styled with:
- Soft pastel color palettes (pinks, lilacs, mints)
- Comic Sans MS font for a fun, girly touch
- Light background grids and readable layouts

## 📈 Visualizations Included
- Bar Chart: Drug regimen timepoints
- Pie Chart: Mouse gender distribution
- Box Plot: Final tumor volume by treatment
- Violin Plot: Tumor volume split by drug and gender
- Line Plot: Capomulin tumor volume over time
- Scatter Plot: Weight vs. tumor volume
- Regression Line: Correlation between weight and tumor size
- Heatmap: Correlation matrix

## 🐭 Key Takeaways
- Capomulin was highly effective in reducing tumor size
- Weight has a strong positive correlation with tumor volume
- Infubinol had one surprising outlier showing reduction in tumor size
- Violin and box plots show consistent effectiveness across Capomulin and Ramicane

## 💾 How to Run
